	Hello, world!
</h1>

Welcome to your BlazingApples's Forum library! Glad you're here. Here's a look into the terminology this package uses:

<h3>Forums</h3>
<p>A "Forum" is a top-level concept that the user should largely be abstracted from.</p>
<p>For example, "Reddit" would be a forum in it of itself.</p>
<p>
	You may have more than one forum only if there is to be no overlap of posting/user's knowledge of another forum.
	Essentially, it's intended for multi-tenant use cases.
</p>


<h3>Threads</h3>
<p>
	A "Thread" is a much like a "subreddit" over in Reddit-land.
	It describes a purpose of posts, and groups posts under a central purpose.
</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/">r/diabetes_t1</a> would be a Thread in our world.</p>

<h3>Posts</h3>
<p>
	A "Post" is content a user generates and other users can comment on.
